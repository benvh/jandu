# Jandu

Jandu is an easy yet enticing game in which you're challenged with building your own little city.
You build your city by placing units next to each other.
Connect 3 or more leaves to create a bush, 3 or more bushes create a tree, and so on.
Can you make it all the way to building a skyscraper before grumpy cats overrun your city?
